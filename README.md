# Skin Disease Recognition App with Machine Learning Model Deployment in Flutter

Welcome to our Skin Disease Recognition App GitHub repository! This project is a collaborative effort by DSW University students to deploy a machine learning model for skin disease recognition into a Flutter application. The application utilizes image recognition technology to identify various skin diseases based on images uploaded by users. We trained our model using the 20 skin diseases dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Overview

Skin diseases can be difficult to diagnose accurately, and timely identification is crucial for effective treatment. Our application aims to assist users in identifying potential skin diseases by analyzing images of affected areas. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and the convenience of a Flutter application, users can receive quick and reliable assessments of their skin condition.

## Features

* **Image Recognition**: Our machine learning model can recognize 20 different skin diseases [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/haroonalam16/20-skin-diseases-dataset] including: Acne, Actinic Carcinoma, Atopic Dermatitis, Bullous Disease, Cellulitis, Eczema, Drug Eruptions, Herpes HPV, Light Diseases, Lupus, Melanoma, Poison IVY, Psoriasis, Benign Tumors, Systemic Disease, Ringworm, Urticarial Hives, Vascular Tumors, Vasculitis, Viral Infections.
* **Multiplatform Compatibility**: The Flutter framework allows our application to run seamlessly on various platforms, with special optimization for Android devices.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features an intuitive user interface designed for ease of use, making it accessible to users of all ages and technical backgrounds.
* **Disease Description**: Upon detection of a skin disease, the application retrieves a description from Wikipedia based on the disease's name. This provides users with additional information about the detected condition, aiding in understanding and awareness.

## Running

To run our project you must:
1. Create new Flutter project.
2. Replace your main.dart with our main.dart file.
3. Replace your pubspec.yaml with our versionn of this file.
4. Put into assets trained model.
5. Compile & Run.
